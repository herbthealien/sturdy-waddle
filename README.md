Welcome to sturdy-waddle, my testing repo!

I'm using this repo to practice my python+version control, and also to program prompts with langchain!

As of this README update, this repo contains a couple of completed python projects:

  -a program to display a welcome message
  -a program to give a hypothetical synopsis for a fake movie with langchain
  -a program to generate a name for a fake movie concept with langchain

It also includes an incomplete python project that uses langchain to start a roleplaying game session.
